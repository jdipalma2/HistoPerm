# HistoPerm
Work in progress

# To-do 
+ Remove old files that have been refactored (i.e., byol_model.py, ...)
+ Add documentation for both code and README
+ Re-organize code into sensible folders
+ Create python requirements file
+ Make this repo a python package (i.e., add a setup.py file for usage with other code)
+ Make HistoPerm module a new class so it can be imported elsewhere
+ Re-factor the model code to be cleaner. Shouldn't have different versions of each model for with or without HistoPerm.
